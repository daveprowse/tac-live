## Introduction

Hello and Welcome!

This repository and corresponding live event are designed to teach the basics of Terraform and prepare you to take the Terraform Associate Certification exam.

Within this [repository](https://github.com/daveprowse/tac-live) you find lab instructions that coincide with the live-stream webinar.

If you are interested in learning more about the Terraform Certification, see my full video course [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/hashicorp-certified-terraform/9780138195366/).

## Recommendations

To follow along with me I suggest you have the following ready:

- A Linux virtual machine (Recommended: Debian, Ubuntu Desktop, or Fedora workstation)

  Minimum 1 CPU and 1 GB RAM (Recommended: 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM)

  Update the system:

    Debian/Ubuntu: `apt update && apt upgrade -y`

    Fedora/CentOS: `dnf update -y`

  > Note: I suggest using VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, KVM or Proxmox for your virtual machines.

- Visual Studio Code installed.

- An AWS account with a separate IAM user for lab purposes (with **admin** permissions and console access).

> Note: !!! Creating infrastructure on AWS or other cloud providers can incur a cost. Do not apply infrastructure if you do not want to be charged. 
> Amazon allows 750 hours of virtual machine usage (per month) on qualifying free tiers at AWS. Make sure that your region and AMI are part of the free tier program. For a pre-cost analysis see this link: https://calculator.aws

- Two or more monitors (or a second system) to display additional resources
